Hello reader! Welcome to my very first post...

<!--more-->

On this blog, I inteed to write about projects I have worked on, projects I am working on and maybe some of my interests outside of software. So go grab your snacks and stay tuned for everything thats coming on this page.

I need to give a big thanks to Simon Freytag and his friday theme that saved me a lot of time and painful CSS. I made the small addition of optional thumbnails for each blog post with a little bit of bootstrap. If you couldnt tell by the domain, The project is being hosted on Github Pages and uses Jekyll because that was the easiest thing for me to do.

Anyway, at the time of writing this most of the site is missing content (I haven't even done a readme yet!) so expect that to be complete soon or for me to continue procrastinating that. Theres not much else for me to say now... 

All the best
 \- Dan
