In addition to a software major project, at the start of this year I also had to create a project for a year 11 subject - Design and Technology.
<!--more-->

I began the process with a grand plan to build a device that can detect posture problems and correct them, not too hard right, but I had the great idea of wanting to build this device so that it was unnoticable. Spoiler Alert! I was unsuccessful in doing this \- what I made was a bit more like a turtle shell as you will see. 

The idea began as an undershirt that someone could wear with a set of sensors on it to detect movement, but that crazy idea was eventually morphed through a lot of brainstorming into a big box on your back with a gyroscope that beeped every time you leant over. It doesn't sound terribly impressive, but it was my first time experimenting with a lot of cool technology \- like an etchant tank, or a laser printer.

I'll give you a bit of a rundown on the...
## Design Process

First we begin with an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, 3 LEDs and a gyroscope. I wrote some code so that if the gyroscope's y angle goes between a \- b, the green light turns on, if its from b \- c, the yellow light turns on and if the angle is between c \- d, the red light turns on. Cool stuff.

I found an arduino nano and then attached that to a breadboard and do a bit of rewiring. The LEDs are replaced with a piezoelectric buzzer because what could possibly be more annoying? I also spent some time making a circuit diagram, in case thats the kind of thing that get you off.

Here comes the good bit... my teacher suggested that I use the school's etchant tank to create my own PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and I was very excited. I designed a board on Eagle again and etched it but I didn't develop well and came out with blotchy copper bits. I also took some time to redraw the board with wider tracks and less shorts. I made this board but I accidentally made it upside down. Third times a charm - and that it was.

(Sorry I didn't have a picture of the second one)

While this was going on, I spent some time sewing an arm brace (Shut up Harry, it's not a bra-strap I swear). This meant I had to learn how to sew with a sewing machine. Believe me, it's a lot harder than it looks. I also designed a box scaffold on illustrator where I can stick my board and things. I cut this out on some ply with the school's laser printer.


I finally put all of these things together in the final product.

Overall, I enjoyed this project a lot \- mostly because of the cool tech I got to use. The end product worked but it was not very practical and it was very heavy. Anyways, it was a cool proof of concept.
