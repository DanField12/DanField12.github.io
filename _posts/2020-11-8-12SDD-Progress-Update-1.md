This year, I have been tasked with developing a software solution to any possible problem. I chose to look at the way I use my passwords and you will see how I solved it (or how I am starting to solve it).

So here is my moment of inspiration... I was working on my previous software project and I was thinking how nice it would be to run Ubuntu on my machine instead of boring old windows. So I opened up the windows CLI and found my operating system key in case I ever want to run windows again. I came to the shocking realisation that I didn't have a safe and secure location to put the key or any other sensitive information such as passwords.

Fast forward 2 months and I'm starting year 12 with very little homework. Instead of booting up Rainbow Six Siege or some other videogame, I figured I may as well get a start on my software project. I did quite a bit of research into how I'm going to go about this project. I started with an encryption specification called AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), Flutter - as I had used it in past projects.

The first code I worte was to encrypt, save and decrypt a message. This is the most important part of my project - that it is secure, whether the data is in a database or stored locally.

So far, I have written a login page where the user has to enter my dummy password. The password then unencrypts the other data on their passwords for a set of websites. These websites are then displayed to them in a list. Each list element is clickable and will open a new screen with some more detail on it.

The codebase can be found [here.](https://github.com/DanField12/dans_password_vault)
